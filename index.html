	<h1> Welcome to my website! </h1>

	I will be making a video game drafting strategy website.

	It will contain information about heroes from the video game DotA 2. It will have their strengths and weaknesses and synergy and combinations with other heroes. The primary focus for this website will be to help people draft heroes in the in-game Pick/Ban phase.

	It will present them information about heroes in a visually accessible manner that makes it easy to access for casual DotA gamers as well as keeping with the fantasy theme of the game.
	
	<h3> Main User: </h3>
	My main user is a DotA 2 player who wants to look at strategies to improve his/her skills at the game

	<h3> My goals: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Have information about as many DotA heroes as possible (there are 109)</li>
		<li> Provide useful strategies to help players draft better </li>
		<li> Have visible hero icons to click on to find out about them </li>
		<li> Team composition page to discuss what team compositions work and don't </li>
	</ul>
